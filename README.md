# iTextCharts

I love the iText 7 library for making PDF files, but noticed there was no chart making API in the library. Looking on
the web I noticed that several people created images of chart and then inserted the images into the PDF documents.
While this does work, I felt that it would be better to have a native library so that there would be a cleaner solution
that scales when you zoom and has the added benefit of the PDF document being small. I am starting with a Bar Chart, 
but plan on adding stacked bar chart, Pie Chart, line chart and many more. I also plan to make them with both vertical 
and horizontal orientations. The end goal is to have clean looking charts with simple API that are highly customizable.
