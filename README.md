# iTextCharts

I love the iText library for making PDF files, but noticed there was no chart making API in the library. Looking on
the web I noticed that several people created images of charts and then inserted the images into the PDF documents.
While this does work, I felt that it would be better to have a native library so that there would be a cleaner solution
and the PDF documents could be  small. I am starting with an XYChart, but plan on adding stacked bar chart, Pie Chart
and many more.
